# redact
A simple UI to redact information from images as I dont want to install too many tools locally.
Possible options are to pixelate or use colored bars.

This page was created using ✨Vibe Coding✨ (Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental), which was rather vibeless as this page is just veeery simple and I just needed a simple tool.
